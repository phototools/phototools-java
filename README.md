PhotoTools
==========

An application to Manage Photo collections. This includes:
* Reading photos from Mobile Devices to a common, directory structure
* Finding and removing duplicates from your photo collection
* PhotoTools is extensible (through OSGi) so additional functionality can be added via plugins

Background

Many mobile devices can take photos but organizing these photos on a common collection can be a challenge.

This application aims to unify this making it possible to create a neat and uniform photo collection with photos and videos
from all your devices.
